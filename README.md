# BlogML-to-WRX
The tool can be used if you need to convert BlogML format into WRX file (WordPress Extended RSS import file format) for subsequent import it into WordPress.

The tool was originally developed by Saravana Kumar and initial code was downloaded from blog  http://blogs.biztalk360.com/migrating-your-blog-from-any-blogml-based-platform-to-wordpress-2/

For detailed description see the blog post "Migrating your blog from any BlogML based platform to WordPress" http://blogs.biztalk360.com/migrating-your-blog-from-any-blogml-based-platform-to-wordpress-2/.

The code in this repository has error handling/logging enhancements and fixed import of multiple comments.
